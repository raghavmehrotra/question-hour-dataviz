                    <p class="block">
                        The first hour of every Parliament session in India is called the Question Hour. It was created <br/>
                        as a way for MPs to hold the government accountable by demanding answers to relevant issues. <br/>
                        Each state's MPs has used the Question Hour in different ways.
                    </p>
                    <p class="block">
                        Choose your state to see how much your MPs have participated in the Question Hour over time.

            <h3 class="subtitle">How do north and south states fare in the Question Hour?</h3>
            <p>Each state has different ways in which they use the Question Hour. We see for example, that Southern states
                consistently ask more questions. Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in particular, have used the Question Hour far
                more than other states. (In general, states with more MPs in the Lok Sabha will have more questions -- which
                explains the high numbers in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh)
