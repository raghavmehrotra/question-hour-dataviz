1. Bugs in state names (Odisha) -- not being replaced correctly
2. Disclaimer for state formation at different stages + various histories
3. Remove comments from the HTML and JS template
4. Finalize all charts before pasting them into HTML
5. Normalize counts (to questions per MP perhaps) or indicate that absolute numbers don't really mean what they appear to mean.

Make sure that you're guiding people through the viz -- for instance, don't open up to a blank screen. Open up to a preset example so the user knows what to do.


Questions:
1. For the line chart, the y axis keeps changing -- how do I indicate this to the reaeder? The variance is quite high, so I cannot standardize the axis.
2. I am still trying to solve the problem of a single question being asked by multiple MPs (therefore multiple states, castes ,genders, constituencies). So far, I have retained only the first person, but this is misleading. One way to solve this is to make N distinct rows for such questions, one per MP. Do you have other suggestions?
3. This is not a question but a clarification -- I am currently using absolute numbers in my analysis but would like to normalize the numbers. One way to do this is to divide by the number of MPs representing a state in the Lok Sabha.
